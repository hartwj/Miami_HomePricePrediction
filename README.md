# Miami_HomePricePrediction

This project was a midterm assignment for a geospatial analysis class. Our goal was to develop a home pricing prediction model in Miami that could compete with Zillow's Zestimate. 
We used spatial analysis and feature engineering to develop a mean absolute error of $80k from actual sales price. 

Please reference "MUSA_Miami_Midterm.R" or "MUSA_Miami_Midterm.Rmd" for the final code.
